57.2 Category Handling
Exception Handling
An online electronics store has 5 product categories - PCs, Notebooks, Tablets, Phones, and Аccessories.
The program you are given declares an array and stores that types into it.
Write a program to take N number as input and output the element of the array with N index. If the index is out of range, program should output "Wrong Option".
Sample Input
5
Sample Output
Wrong Option

58.2 No Zeroes
Multiple Exceptions
You need to write a divider program which will operate with integers,
The program you are given should take two integers as input and execute the division, but we need to handle two exceptions:
1. the divider shouldn't be zero
2. both inputs should be integers.
Complete the program to handle them. For the first exception, the program should output "Еrror: division by zero"; and for the second one, "Error: wrong value type".
Sample Input
1
b
Sample Output
Error: wrong value type

59.2 Welcome
Threads
We are writing a registration program for our app. At first it should welcome the users, then ask the users to enter their names.
But program you are given executes this sequence in reverse order.
Complete the program by extending the Thread class for Welcome and Name classes, then setting priorities for their run methods so that the program outputs the messages in the correct order.
Use setPriority(number) method on the objects - obj.setPriority(number).
The higher the number, the higher the priority.

Sample Output
{Robert=32, John=28}
Hint
Use get() method to access values in the HashMap and remove() to delete them.
