30.2 Loading, Loading, Loading
Creating Classes & Objects
Create a program to show loading message to your application users.
Define a class Loading which has one public method called LoadingMessage(), which should print "Loading" when called.
Create an object named loading and call that method.
Don't forget to use new keyword while creating an object.

31.2 Tracking Customer Data
Class Attributes
You are the administrator of a hotel and must create customer information cards for your new customers. On the card, you must note the customerâ€™s first and last name, age, and room number.

32.2 Going Places
Access Modifiers
You're a tour manager and you need to have a list of countries along with its capitals.
You're given a program which creates Country object and you should output the name and the capital, but something goes wrong.
Task
Change the access modifiers of the Country class fields in order to perform the required output.
Use public access modifier to provide access to any other classes.

32.3 Total Salries
Access Modifiers
You are a manager at company that have two employees, James and Tom.
You wrote a program to calculate total employee salary: it creates two objects for workers and sets the corresponding parameters.
But something is wrong. The program doesn't provide access to attributes. Fix it.
Also complete the method to calculate and return the total salary.

33.2 Student Information System
Getters and Setters
The program you are given receives name and age of student as input.
Complete the program to set the values for the corresponding attributes of the Student class and prints out the final result. If the age is <0, program should output "Invalid age" and assign a 0 value to the age attribute.
Sample Input
Olivia
-2
Sample Output
Invalid age
Name: Olivia
Age: 0
Explanation
-2 is invalid value for age attribute, that's why "Invalid age" and "Age: 0" is printed. Setter and Getter should handle this.
You need to handle the conditions inside the Getter and the Setter.

41.0 Binary Converter
inary Converter


The binary numeric system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.

You need to make a program to convert integer numbers to their binary representation.
Create a Converter class with a static toBinary() method, which returns the binary version of its argument.
The code in main takes a number as input and calls the corresponding static method. Make sure the code works as expected.

Sample Input:
42
Sample Output:
101010

You can use the following code to convert a number to binary:
