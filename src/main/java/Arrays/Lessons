21.1 Arrays

An array is a collection of variables of the same type.
When you need to store a list of values, such as numbers, you can store them in an array, instead of declaring separate variables for each number.

To declare an array, you need to define the type of the elements with square brackets.
For example, to declare an array of integers:
int[ ] arr;
JAVA
The name of the array is arr. The type of elements it will hold is int.

Now, you need to define the array's capacity, or the number of elements it will hold. To accomplish this, use the keyword new
int[ ] arr = new int[5];
JAVA
The code above declares an array of 5 integers.
In an array, the elements are ordered and each has a specific and constant position, which is called an index.

To reference elements in an array, type the name of the array followed by the index position within a pair of square brackets.
Example:
arr[2] = 42;
JAVA
This assigns a value of 42 to the element with 2 as its index.
Note that elements in the array are identified with zero-based index numbers, meaning that the first element's index is 0 rather than one. So, the maximum index of the array int[5] is 4.


22.1 Summing Element in Arrays
Array Length

You can access the length of an array (the number of elements it stores) via its length property.
Example:
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[ ] intArr = new int[5];
        System.out.println(intArr.length);
    }
}
23.1 Enchanced for Loop

The enhanced for loop (sometimes called a "for each" loop) is used to traverse elements in arrays.
The advantages are that it eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code easier to read.
Example:
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[ ] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7};

        for (int t: primes) {
            System.out.println(t);
        }
    }
}

24.1 Multidimentional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays are array that contain other arrays. The two-dimensional array is the most basic multidimensional array.
To create multidimensional arrays, place each array within its own set of square brackets.
Example of a two-dimensional array:
int[ ][ ] sample = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
JAVA
This declares an array with two arrays as its elements.
To access an element in the two-dimensional array, provide two indexes, one for the array, and another for the element inside that array.
The following example accesses the first element in the second array of sample.
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[ ][ ] sample = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
        int x = sample[1][0];
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
